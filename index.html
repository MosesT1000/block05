      <h2>Bears</h2>
      <p>
        Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as
        small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as
        eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear).
        They’re found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

      <h2>Giraffes</h2>
      <p>
        Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs
        and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about
        6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an
        hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour
        over longer distances.

      <h2>Monkeys</h2>
      <p>
        The presence of a tail (even if only a tiny nub), along with their
        narrow-chested bodies and other features of the skeleton, distinguishes
        monkeys from apes. Most monkeys have a short, relatively flat face
        without great prominence of the muzzle, although baboons and mandrills
        are notable exceptions.
